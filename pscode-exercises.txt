// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

if num % 2 == 0, result = "even"
else result = "odd"


// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

read in and store num1, num2, num3, num4, num5
avg = (num1 + num2 + num3 + num4 + num5) / 5.0

if num1 > num2, max = num1
else max = num2

if num3 > max, max = num3
else max = max from last block

if num4 > max, max = num4
else max = max from last block

if num5 > max, max = num5
else max = max from last block

print("average is " + avg + " and the max is " + max)
